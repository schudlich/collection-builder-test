"Hell&#39;s Half Acre","Keeping Watch","","Example compound object. Hells Half Acre is an R-6 cabin that is easily accessible by road in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Originally a platform on top of a forty-foot-tall tower, the original Hell&#39;s Half Acre cabin was an L-4.  Now one of the most popular lookouts in Idaho or Montana, it sits above a snag forest of mostly lodgepole pine. A sign at the base of the summit informs drivers that the tower opens at 9 am. Unsure if this refers to mountain or pacific time, we wait at the sign and drink our coffee.","","","45.64579","-114.62838","Keeping Watch Fire Tower Oral HIstory Project","","record","compound_object","eng","In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.
